# TOP_google-homepage



This is the Google mock up homepage without any functionality. I created this as
proof that I posses the fundamentals concepts of css and Html.

This lesson can be found @ The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)
My completed mini-project can be found [here](https://xxerror500xx.github.io/TOP_google-homepage/)

This contains both the Easy (google-homepage) and the Harder exercise (google
  search results page.)
