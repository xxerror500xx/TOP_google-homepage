# TOP_google-homepage



This is the Google mock up homepage without any functionality. I created this as
proof that I posses the fundamentals concepts of css and Html.

This project is not meant to be a perfect clone and the search functionality is
a mock up only.

My completed (easy) mini-project can be found [here](https://xxerror500xx.github.io/TOP_google-homepage/)

This contains both the Easy (google-homepage) and the Harder exercise (google
  search results page.)
